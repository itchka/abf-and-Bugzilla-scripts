Things that need fixing:
""" If there are three quotes in a field it blows googles import




If there is a + in the package name th record is split i.e. c++ Timidity++ etc
If you get a field like this for the error description cell this breaks Google import
File '/usr/bin/xxx"

Basically intermediate quotes " in a field should be escaped I think this will fix all issues.





FIXED
The ++ problem is because I am using + as a line separator this subsequently is replaced by new lines in the case of c++ I would get
c

next package.
Fixed by using a char pair +! as the separator
