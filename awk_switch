Use awk to speed up failed build list generation.
Currcetly we set loads of variables by passing the contents of the of the $project_log to grep and recording the result. 
Next a large if-then-else statement is used to assign a flag status to another variable which is then passed to a bash case statement. 
This is necessary because the case statement in bash does not support regexes.
One way to speed up the process is to pass the $project_log to awk and use the awk switch statement act directly on the project_log. 
If it works then project loag would only need to be read once. 

BEGIN
Pass the external variable $project_log to awk

awk -v=$project_log

case $project_log
